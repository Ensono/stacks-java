= IDE guidelines for the Java Rest API

== IDE guidelines

The IDE we have used is Intellij.

We recommend that you install the following plugins:

* Lombok - To reduce the amount of boiler-plate code that needs to be
written
* SonarLint - Fix and detect code quality issues
(https://www.sonarlint.org/)
* Spring Assistant - An IntelliJ plugin for aiding Spring development
projects (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10229-spring-assistant)
* Spring Tools - Adds Spring support for IDEs (https://spring.io/tools)
* CheckStyle - Flags up issues with coding style
(https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/)
* google-java-format Formatter - Formats code according to configuration
(https://github.com/amido/stacks-java/blob/master/tools/formatter/intellij-java-google-style.xml)

=== Plugins used in POM

* Lombok - Avoids need to write e.g. Getter, Setter,
RequiredArgsConstructor, ToString, EqualsAndHashCode) in Java classes.
* JaCoCo - A free Java code test coverage library.
* Surefire - Used for reporting purposes (creates reports based on tests
in the Java test package).
* fmt-maven-plugin - Formats the java code based on rules in
java-google-style.xml.
* Spotbugs - Performs a static analysis of the Java code to check for
bugs.

=== Set up the project

==== How to import the whole project

In the IDE(We used Intellij) go to File -> New -> Project. Set project
SDK to Java 11. Click Next -> Next

==== What setup required to get it up and running

Open up the "java" folder and right click on pom.xml and choose "Add as
Maven Project". Click on Run -> Edit Configurations

Configurations_1] Choose the main class as "Application.java" and set
any relevant variables, such as to set environment variable for
*AZURE_COSMOSDB_KEY* and set JRE to Java 11. Click OK

=== Code Quality

==== Formatter

Install the `intellij-java-google-style.xml` formatter configuration
file into the IDE from
https://github.com/amido/stacks-java/blob/master/tools/formatter/intellij-java-google-style.xml[here].

The Java source code will automatically be reformatted to comply with
the https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html[Google Java
Style].

You can override the settings locally in the codebase by adding, for
example:

[source,prism-code]
----
//@formatter:off
manually formatted code
///@formatter:on
----

===== Validating and applying formatting

From the `<PROJECT-NAME>/java` folder run

* Unix

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw com.coveo:fmt-maven-plugin:check
----

* Windows

[source,shell]
----
mvnw.cmd com.coveo:fmt-maven-plugin:check
----

To validate the current formatting. You can then run the below code to
apply formatting to the source code.

* Unix

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw com.coveo:fmt-maven-plugin:format
----

* Windows

[source,shell]
----
mvnw.cmd com.coveo:fmt-maven-plugin:format
----

==== Verifying common programming flaws

* Unix

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw spotbugs:check
----

* Windows

[source,shell]
----
mvnw.cmd spotbugs:check
----
